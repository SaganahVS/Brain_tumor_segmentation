Here's a properly formatted version of your **Brain Tumor Classification System** project documentation, with clear sections and Markdown-friendly formatting for use in a `README.md` or documentation file:

# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification System

This project implements a Brain Tumor Classification System using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect tumor types from MRI images. It uses a custom-trained model and features an interactive **Gradio UI** for image-based predictions.

---

## 🔍 Features

* ✅ Classifies brain MRI scans into:

  * **Glioma**
  * **Meningioma**
  * **No Tumor**
  * **Pituitary**
* ✅ Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** for model architecture and training
* ✅ Uses **OpenCV** for image preprocessing
* ✅ Applies **LabelBinarizer** for multi-class output encoding
* ✅ Provides an intuitive **Gradio interface** for drag-and-drop predictions

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Load and preprocess** brain MRI images (resized to `128x128`).
2. **Train a CNN model** using layers like:

   * `Conv2D`
   * `MaxPooling2D`
   * `Dropout`
3. **Predict tumor type** from new MRI images using the trained model.
4. **Display results** with confidence scores via the Gradio interface.

## 📁 Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy scikit-learn gradio
```

If running in **Google Colab**, also install:

```bash
pip install google-colab
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab

1. Upload your dataset to your **Google Drive**.
2. Mount Google Drive in your Colab notebook:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
3. Ensure your dataset path is correctly referenced (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/brain_tumor_dataset`).

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. Clone/download the project and place the dataset in a directory:

   ```
   brain_tumor_classification/
   ├── model/
   ├── dataset/
   │   ├── glioma/
   │   ├── meningioma/
   │   ├── notumor/
   │   └── pituitary/
   ├── main.py
   └── ...
   ```
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🖼️ Gradio UI

Once the model is trained or loaded, Gradio will launch an interactive web interface for you to upload an image and view predictions:

```python
import gradio as gr
gr.Interface(fn=predict_fn, inputs="image", outputs="label").launch()
```

Would you like help creating the actual `main.py` or model training script?
